A Universal File Organizer

UFO is a command-line tool designed to automatically present the files and sub-folders of a given folder as a meta-filesystem, allowing you to find files easily in an otherwise disorganized folder.

## What is a Meta-Filesystem?
UFO does not physically move any of the files in the folder and subfolders it is in charge of. Instead, it organizes them in a filesystem that exists only inside the program. To open a specific file, simply find it in UFO's filesystem and it will open it for you. We call this a meta-filesystem because it exists as separate entity over top of your computer's filesystem.
